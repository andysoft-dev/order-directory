# Order Directory

Order Directory is a little script created in Python, based in https://github.com/nschurmann/organizrb. Create a directory for each extension file and move all files with this extension. The idea is to have each type of file in its respective directory.

Thanks to HolaMundo youtube Channel for that idea ;-)
